## Code Review Requirements

**IMPORTANT**: Request code review after completing multi-step coding tasks! This ensures code quality and catches issues early.

### When to Request Review

**REQUIRED for:**
- Core functionality changes
- New features or bug fixes
- API/schema modifications
- Refactoring (even without behavior changes)
- Security-sensitive code

**OPTIONAL for:**
- Documentation/comment changes
- Typo fixes
- Debug logging
- Test modifications (unless changing behavior)

### Review Process

1. **Complete your todo list first**
   - Finish all implementation tasks
   - Run tests to ensure code works
   - THEN request review before marking complete

2. **Request review using the MCP tool**
   Use the mcp__claude-reviewer__request_review tool with:
   - `summary`: Brief description of changes made
   - `focus_areas`: Areas needing special attention
   - `test_command`: Command to run tests (optional)

3. **Address feedback**
   - Fix critical/major issues
   - Request follow-up review if needed
   - Mark review complete when approved

### Example Workflow

After completing todo items:
1. Request initial review with a summary of your changes
2. If changes needed, make fixes based on feedback
3. Request follow-up review referencing the previous review ID
4. Mark review complete when approved

**Remember**: It's better to request unnecessary reviews than miss important feedback!
